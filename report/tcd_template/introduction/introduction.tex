\chapter{Introduction} Reinforcement Learning is a branch of Machine Learning that seeks to advise an agent in the actions it ought to take in some environment so as to
maximise some cumulative reward. The purpose of this project is to compare and contrast the effectiveness of several Reinforcement Learning algorithms in the application
of teaching a Deep Neural Network to effectively play a selection of Atari 2600 video games. We aim to keep the architecture of the solution constant as the game being
played changes, that is to say that the solution should be theoretically applicable to any game it has never seen before. The Atari 2600 is a popular video game console,
first released on September 11, 1977. In order to use these games on a modern day computer, the Open AI Gym platform is used. Open AI Gym is a toolkit for developing and
comparing Reinforcement Learning algorithms. It conveniently provides an environment for us that is capable of emulating several games for the Atari.

\section{Fonts, sizes, justification}

Throughout the document, a sans-serif font should be used. The font size should be 12 pt for main text. The text should be left justified and without hyphenation. Avoid
italics and boldface in the main text. These font requirements comply with TCD policy on accessibility.

The page number should appear at the bottom of each page starting at 1 on the first page of the Introduction chapter. 

\section{Headings of sections and subsections}
Chapters should be divided into appropriate subsections. The section should be numbered sequentially from 1 within each chapter (e.g. 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 etc.).

\subsection{Subsection name style}
The subsections if used should be numbered sequentially within each section. You should really try to avoid using subsubsections, but if you do they should not be
numbered.

\subsubsection*{Subsection} This is a subsection. The asterisk after the command means it won't be printed with a number.

\subsection{Length of the report}
The page margins are set to 2.54 cm top, bottom, left and right. There may be a table or figure for which it is sensible to deviate from these margins, but in general the
main text should be formatted within the specified margins.

The body of the report should be organized into several chapters. There are a number of chapters that you must have: an introduction; a background or literature review
chapter; and a conclusion chapter. The focus of the other chapters will depend on your specific project.

The body of the report must be no more 60 pages for MAI. This does not include the front matter, references list and any appendices. In other words, from the first page
of the Introduction to the last page of the Conclusions chapters must be less than 60 pages for MAI.

If you exceed these page limits or deviate significantly from this format, you will lose marks.

\section{Contents of the Introduction}
The introduction presents the nature of the problem under consideration, the context of the problem to the wider field and the scope of the project. The objectives of the
project should be clearly stated.

\section{Contents of the background chapter}
The second chapter is typically a literature review, or survey of the state of the art, or a detailed assessment of the context and background for the project. The exact
nature of this chapter depends on the topic and/or methods of the project. It is essential that the work of other people is properly cited. This will be discussed in
detail in chapter 2 below. Note that you should use references wherever is appropriate through the report, not just in the literature review chapter.

\section{The Conclusions chapter}
The final chapter should give a short summary of the key methods, results and findings in your project. You should also briefly identify what, if any, future work might
be executed to resolve unanswered questions or to advance the study beyond the scope that you identified in Chapter 1.
